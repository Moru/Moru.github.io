In Austria, Stollen resembles a fruit cake. There they add: 
50 g (1/2 c.) red currants 
40 g (1/4 c.) cherries  

Preparation 

Combine the fruit, peel and zest with the rum to macerate; 
place the butter, milk and sugar in a small saucepan; heat gently until the sugar is dissolved; 
in a bowl, combine the flour, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, yeast and cardamom; 
make a well in the centre; pour the melted butter mixture and the eggs into the well; knead all the ingredients together for 5 minutes to form a smooth, supple dough; if the dough is too sticky, add a little more flour; add in the macerated fruit, peel, zest and almonds; 
cover with greased paper and leave to rise for 3 hours, until the dough has doubled in volume; 
knead again on a floured surface; roll out into a 25 cm (10") square; 
spread the marzipan over the centre; fold each side over to form a rectangle; 
turn over and place on a buttered baking sheet; cover with greased paper and let rise again for one hour or until doubled in volume; 
place into a preheated 190° C (375° F) oven and bake for approximately 40 minutes, or until the bread is nicely browned and produces a hollow sound when the bottom is rapped; 
remove from the oven; brush with melted butter; sprinkle with icing sugar.
